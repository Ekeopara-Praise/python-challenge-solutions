'''2. Write a Python program to check whether a given number is an ugly number.
Input : 12
Output : True
Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose only prime factors are 2, 3 or 5. The sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, ...
shows the first 10 ugly numbers.
Note: 1 is typically treated as an ugly number '''

def is_ugly(num):
        if num == 0:
            return False
        for i in [2, 3, 5]:
            while num % i == 0:
                num /= i
        return num == 1

print(is_ugly(12))
print(is_ugly(13))
