'''2. Write a Python program to sort a list of elements using Selection sort.
According to Wikipedia "In computer science, selection sort is a sorting algorithm, 
specifically an in-place comparison sort. It has O(n2) time complexity, making it inefficient on large lists, 
and generally performs worse than the similar insertion sort". '''
